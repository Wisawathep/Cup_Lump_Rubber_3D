# Weighing Cup Lump Rubber using 3-Dimensional Scale
This project presents a three-dimensional weighing system for cup lump rubber using 3D scanning technology. The system captures multiple images of cup lump rubber from different angles to reconstruct a 3D model, which is then used to calculate its volume. The calculated volume is compared with the actual weight obtained from a physical scale to detect inconsistencies caused by foreign substances mixed into the rubber. The proposed solution aims to improve transparency and fairness in rubber trading by reducing reliance on manual inspection.

## ⭐ Motivation
Cup lump rubber is a major agricultural product in Thailand and a primary source of income for many farmers. However, weight fraud caused by mixing unknown substances into rubber leads to unfair pricing and lack of trust between buyers and sellers. This project was motivated by the need to create a reliable, objective, and technology-driven method for evaluating rubber weight, supporting transparency in the agricultural supply chain while aligning with the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model.

## 🔑 Key Features
- 3D Scanning for Shape Reconstruction : Captures images of cup lump rubber from multiple angles to generate an accurate 3D model.
- Automatic Volume Calculation : Computes the volume of the rubber directly from the reconstructed 3D model, reducing reliance on manual estimation.
- Weight Consistency Verification : Compares the calculated volume-based weight with the actual weight from a digital scale to detect inconsistencies.
- Foreign Object Detection Support : Helps identify possible foreign materials mixed into the rubber based on abnormal volume-to-weight ratios.
- Reduced Human Dependency : Minimizes subjective judgment by introducing a data-driven and automated evaluation process.
